# Trading View Chart integration with Binance API

It leverages the Binance API for fetching comprehensive market statistics, including 24-hour ticker data and exchange information, and integrates the powerful TradingView Charting Library for advanced technical analysis.
The project features dynamic categorization of markets into "Hot," "Top Gainers," and "Top Losers," complete with client-side sorting capabilities. Users can easily navigate between market categories and view detailed, live charts for any selected cryptocurrency. The application utilizes SCSS for a clean, dark-themed user interface and ensures a smooth user experience with robust API error handling and efficient data processing

This project uses [Binance API](https://github.com/binance/binance-spot-api-docs/blob/master/rest-api.md) integrated with [TradingView Charts](https://www.tradingview.com/)
